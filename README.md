Processing 3 bouncing balls simulation using real-life physics

I've searched google a lot for proper bouncing ball simulation programs with no luck. So I took a little help from my physics notes and coded a cute little program which simulates ball-to-ball collisions pretty well (I think). I mean I'm pretty new to OOP so any suggestions for improvements more than welcome.
